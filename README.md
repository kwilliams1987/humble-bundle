Humble Bundle Library
=====================

This repository contains a list of all my Humble Bundle games, along with their claim status.

If a game is here and not claimed, you are free to have it.

Please be considerate when requesting games, I am doing this initiative on good faith and hope you respect that by only taking games you will actually play.

I will continue to update this repo with any new games I get in the future.

Note that there is a delay in updating the lists and some games may have been claimed without me remembering. Sorry about that :(

# Claiming a game

To request a key, please open a pull request moving the game from the [AVAILABLE.md](/AVAILABLE.md) file to [CLAIMED.md](/CLAIMED.md).

Title the PR with the name of the game you would like, and make sure to update the icon when transferring.

Please create a new PR for each game you wish to claim, we can then arrange how to transfer the key safely.

Email addresses added to PRs will be removed by me as soon as I've send the email, however _they still remain in the comment history_.

If you prefer, you may use a disposable mail address such as https://mytemp.email/ to protect your privacy.

Requests will be handled on a first-come, first served basis at my disgression.

I reserve the right to reject any request if I feel the person is not doing so in good faith.
